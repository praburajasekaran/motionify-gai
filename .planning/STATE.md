## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 3 phases (not 5) | "Quick" depth → combine research suggestions into fewer phases | Applied |
| Polling for real-time (not Ably) | Simpler v1; Ably upgrade possible in v2 | Applied |
| Comment editing included | Could Have priority; valuable for corrections | Applied |
| Ably deferred to v2 | True real-time nice-to-have; polling sufficient for MVP | Applied |
| Denormalized user_name column | Avoid joins on reads for better performance | Applied |
| Separate component sets for portals | Admin SPA and Next.js have different import paths | Applied |
| 10-second polling interval | Balances freshness with server load | Applied |
| Page Visibility API for battery efficiency | Only poll when page is visible | Applied |
| since parameter for efficient polling | Reduces data transfer by fetching only new comments | Applied |
| Environment variable for API URL | Removes hardcoded localhost, allows per-environment configuration | Applied |
| R2 presigned URLs for file uploads | Leverage existing infrastructure, no custom storage needed | Applied |
| Permissive UUID regex | Strict RFC regex rejected valid UUIDs; prioritize compatibility | Applied |
| Centralized CORS headers | Ensure all API responses (even errors) have proper CORS | Applied |
| Callback prop for attachment flow | Use onAttachmentsChange to sync child state to parent ref | Applied |
| Export child types for parent use | Export PendingAttachment from CommentInput for CommentThread type safety | Applied |

### Technical Context

**Infrastructure Completed:**
- `proposal_comments` table with proper schema (UUIDs, indexes, foreign keys)
- `netlify/functions/comments.ts` API with GET/POST/PUT endpoints
- `lib/comments.ts` API client functions
- `comment_attachments` table with foreign key to comments
- `netlify/functions/attachments.ts` API with GET/POST endpoints
- `lib/attachments.ts` client library for both portals
- `netlify/functions/send-email.ts` with `sendCommentNotificationEmail` function
- CommentThread, CommentItem, CommentInput components for admin SPA
- CommentThread, CommentItem, CommentInput components for Next.js client portal
- Integration in admin ProposalDetail.tsx (before Response Tracking)
- Integration in client proposal page (after ProposalActions)
- Real-time polling with 10-second interval in both portals
- since parameter for efficient polling API optimization
- File upload UI with progress tracking
- Attachment display and download functionality
- Email notification on new comments (sender excluded)
- In-app notification creation in notifications table
- NotificationContext integration for comment notifications
- Client portal NotificationContext at `landing-page-new/src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`
- Client portal NotificationProvider in `landing-page-new/src/app/layout.tsx`
- Client portal CommentThread notification trigger
- Client portal NotificationBell using NotificationContext
- **Robust Error Handling:** CORS headers on all responses, safe DB connections
- **Validation:** Permissive UUID regex, 10MB file limit, file type restrictions
- **Attachment Data Flow:** CommentInput → onAttachmentsChange callback → CommentThread → pendingAttachmentsRef
- **PendingAttachment Type:** Exported from CommentInput for parent component type safety
- **Scroll Preservation:** scrollPosRef tracks position, restores on polling updates when user actively reading
- **Edit Handlers:** handleEdit passed to CommentItem, inline editing functional for comment owners

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- Vite SPA admin portal: `pages/admin/ProposalDetail.tsx`
- Next.js client portal: `landing-page-new/src/app/proposal/[proposalId]/page.tsx`
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Netlify Functions for API layer
- R2 presign for file uploads
- NotificationContext.tsx for in-app notifications
- Resend for email

### Known Gaps (Deferred)

| Gap | Phase | Action Required |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| Ably pricing at scale | v2 | Evaluate if polling UX sufficient before upgrade |
| @mentions parsing/rendering | Future | Not in v1 scope |
| Comment replies/threading | Future | Flat comments for v1 (like Fiverr) |
