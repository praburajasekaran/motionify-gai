## Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal:** Users can view and persist comments in the proposal detail page with a working database and API layer.

### Requirements
- **COMM-07:** Comments Embedded in Proposal Page
- **COMM-08:** Persistent Comments

### Dependencies
- Existing: Proposal detail pages (`landing-page-new/.../proposal/[proposalId]/page.tsx`, `pages/admin/ProposalDetail.tsx`)
- Existing: PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Existing: Netlify Functions infrastructure

### Success Criteria

1. **Users see comment section on proposal detail page**
   Client users viewing `landing-page-new/src/app/proposal/[proposalId]/page.tsx` see a comment thread section. Superadmins viewing `pages/admin/ProposalDetail.tsx` also see the comment section. Both views show an empty state when no comments exist.

2. **Comments persist in database across sessions**
   When a comment is posted, it is stored in the `proposal_comments` table. Closing and reopening the browser (or starting a new session) displays previously posted comments in chronological order.

3. **Both user types can view the same comment thread**
   A client and superadmin viewing the same proposalId see identical comments. Comments are filtered by proposal (no cross-proposal leakage).

---

## Phase 2: Core Comment Experience

**Goal:** Users can post comments freely, see updates via polling, and edit their own comments before replies.

### Requirements
- **COMM-01:** Unlimited Comment Exchange
- **COMM-02:** Real-Time Comment Updates
- **COMM-06:** Comment Editing

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 complete (database schema, API, embedded UI exist)

### Success Criteria

1. **Both parties can post comments without turn restrictions**
   A client can post multiple consecutive comments without waiting for a superadmin response. A superadmin can similarly post multiple comments in sequence. Neither party encounters "waiting for response" restrictions.

2. **New comments appear without page refresh**
   When User A posts a comment, User B sees it appear within 10 seconds without manually refreshing the page. The comment stream updates automatically via polling.

3. **User can edit their own recent comments**
   A user sees an "Edit" button on comments they authored. Clicking edit opens a form to modify the comment content. Edited comments display an edit indicator.

4. **Edit option unavailable after replies**
   Once another user replies to a comment, the "Edit" button disappears from that comment. The user can no longer edit that comment.

### Plans
- [x] `02-01-comment-editing-PLAN.md` — PUT endpoint + edit UI for both portals
- [x] `02-02-realtime-polling-PLAN.md` — Polling for real-time updates + API URL fix

---

## Phase 3: Attachments & Notifications

**Goal:** Users can attach files to comments and receive notifications when new comments are posted.

### Requirements
- **COMM-03:** File Attachments on Comments
- **COMM-04:** Email Notifications on Comments
- **COMM-05:** In-App Notifications

### Dependencies
- Phase 2 complete (comment posting, viewing, editing work)
- Existing: R2 presign API (`netlify/functions/r2-presign.ts`)
- Existing: NotificationContext.tsx
- Existing: Resend email integration

### Success Criteria

1. **Users can attach files to comments**
   When composing a comment, a user can click "Attach file" and select a file from their device. After upload, the file appears as an attachment below the comment. Both parties can download attached files.

2. **Users receive email notifications on new comments**
   When a client posts a comment, the assigned superadmin receives an email notification. When a superadmin posts a comment, the client receives an email. Emails contain a preview of the comment and a link to the proposal.

3. **In-app notification badge updates on new comments**
   Users see a notification badge increment when new comments are posted. The notification is visible in the existing notification dropdown/panel. Clicking the notification navigates to the proposal with the comment highlighted.

4. **Attachment upload uses existing R2 infrastructure**
    Files upload via the existing R2 presigned URL system. No custom file storage implementation required. Upload respects existing file type and size policies.

### Plans
- [x] `03-01-PLAN.md` — File attachments infrastructure (database, API, UI)
- [x] `03-02-PLAN.md` — Email + in-app notifications (admin portal complete)
- [x] `03-03-PLAN.md` — Gap closure: Client portal notification infrastructure
- [x] `03-04-PLAN.md` — Gap closure: Backend robustness (CORS, DB safety)
- [x] `03-05-PLAN.md` — Gap closure: Client API path and validation fixes

## Phase 4: Integration & Polish

**Goal:** Fix UAT failures - database migration, attachment flow, polling stale closure, auto-scroll, and edit button logic.

### Requirements
- **COMM-02:** Real-Time Comment Updates (polling fixes, auto-scroll)
- **COMM-03:** File Attachments on Comments (complete attachment flow, fix duplicates)
- **COMM-06:** Comment Editing (hasSubsequentReplies logic)

### Gap Closure
Addresses 9 diagnosed gaps from UAT:
- **Blocker:** Database migration not applied (500 errors)
- **Major:** Attachment flow broken (duplicates, not submitting, multiple files)
- **Major:** Polling stale closure (new comments invisible until refresh)
- **Major:** Missing auto-scroll to new comments
- **Major:** Edit button appears on all own comments (missing hasSubsequentReplies check)

### Dependencies
- Phase 3 complete (attachment upload and API endpoints exist)
- Existing: CommentThread, CommentInput, CommentItem components in both portals

### Success Criteria

1. **Database schema matches code expectations**
   Migration 002 applied, proposal_comments table has author_id/author_type columns, API returns 200 responses.

2. **Attachments submit correctly with comments**
   Single and multiple file attachments flow from CommentInput to CommentThread, comment_attachments table populated, files appear once in preview.

3. **Polling shows new comments automatically**
   Stale closure fixed with useRef, new comments appear within 10 seconds without manual refresh.

4. **Smart auto-scroll implemented**
   Page scrolls to new comment when user near bottom, preserves position when reading middle, always scrolls after own comment.

5. **Edit button only on comments without subsequent replies**
   Edit button hidden after another user replies, visible on most recent comment, works in both portals.

### Plans
- [x] `04-01-PLAN.md` — Wire attachment data flow via callback, verify edit/scroll implementations
- [ ] `04-02-PLAN.md` — Apply database migration 002 (blocker)
- [ ] `04-03-PLAN.md` — Fix attachment flow (duplicates, submission, multiple files)
- [ ] `04-04-PLAN.md` — Fix polling stale closure and implement smart auto-scroll
- [ ] `04-05-PLAN.md` — Implement hasSubsequentReplies edit button logic

**Plan Count:** 5 plans in 2 waves (02 in wave 1, 03-05 in wave 2)

## Phase 5: Credential Wiring Fix

**Goal:** Fix missing `credentials: 'include'` on fetch calls exposed by PROD-01 security hardening.

### Requirements
- **COMM-05:** In-App Notifications (admin portal fetch calls)
- **COMM-06:** Comment Editing (client portal handleEdit)

### Gap Closure
Addresses 2 integration gaps from v1 milestone audit:
- **Gap 1:** Client portal handleEdit missing credentials → 401 on comment edit
- **Gap 2:** Admin portal NotificationContext missing credentials → 401 on notification fetch/update

### Dependencies
- PROD-01 complete (cookie-based auth now required on all endpoints)
- Existing: CommentThread.tsx in client portal
- Existing: NotificationContext.tsx in admin portal

### Success Criteria

1. **Client portal comment editing works**
   User can edit their comment in client portal, PUT /comments returns 200, comment updates in UI.

2. **Admin portal notifications work**
   NotificationContext fetches notifications on mount, badge shows correct count, mark-as-read functions.

### Plans
- [ ] `05-01-PLAN.md` — Add credentials: 'include' to 4 fetch calls (2 files)

**Plan Count:** 1 plan

## Phase 6: Database Schema Alignment

**Goal:** Fix database schema mismatch so comment creation and editing work correctly.

### Requirements
- **COMM-06:** Comment Editing (blocked by schema mismatch)

### Gap Closure
Addresses critical schema mismatch from v1 milestone audit:
- **Blocker:** Backend expects `author_id`/`author_type` columns but Phase 1 schema file used `user_id`
- **Root Cause:** Migration 002 has correct schema but unclear if applied
- **Impact:** Comment creation and editing may fail with column-not-found errors

### Dependencies
- Phase 5 complete (credential wiring fixed)
- Existing: Migration 002 exists with correct schema
- Existing: Backend code expects `author_id`/`author_type`

### Success Criteria

1. **Database has correct column names**
   The `proposal_comments` table has `author_id` and `author_type` columns matching backend expectations.

2. **Comment creation works end-to-end**
   POST /comments successfully inserts a row with author_id and author_type values.

3. **Comment editing works end-to-end**
   PUT /comments/{id} successfully updates content for the comment owner.

4. **Schema files aligned**
   Phase 1 schema file updated to match migration 002 for documentation consistency.

### Plans
- [ ] `06-01-PLAN.md` — Apply migration 002 and align schema files

**Plan Count:** 1 plan
