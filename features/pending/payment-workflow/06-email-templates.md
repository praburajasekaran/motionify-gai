## Email Design Guidelines

### Visual Design

- **Format**: Plain text for maximum deliverability
- **Width**: 75 characters per line max
- **Spacing**: Use line breaks and dividers (━) for visual separation
- **Buttons**: ASCII art boxes for CTA buttons with centered text

### Tone & Voice

- **Client Emails**: Friendly, professional, encouraging
- **Admin Emails**: Direct, informative, action-oriented
- **Consistency**: Use Motionify brand voice throughout

### Accessibility

- **Subject Lines**: 45-60 characters for mobile visibility
- **Preview Text**: First 50 chars should summarize email purpose
- **Link Text**: Descriptive (not "click here")
- **Readability**: Short paragraphs, bullet points for scanning

### Variable Handling

All templates use Handlebars syntax:

```handlebars
{{variableName}}                    // Simple variable
{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}         // Conditional block
{{#each items}}...{{/each}}         // Loop through array
{{currencySymbol}}{{amount}}        // Currency formatting
```

### Currency Display

Always show currency symbol with amount:
- INR: `₹40,000.00`
- USD: `$500.00`

Format: `{{currencySymbol}}{{amount}}`

### Testing Checklist

Before deploying any template:

- [ ] Test all variable substitutions
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Check mobile rendering
- [ ] Test with missing optional variables
- [ ] Verify attachments (if any)
- [ ] Check spam score (use Mail Tester)
- [ ] Test in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
- [ ] Verify unsubscribe link (if transactional allows)

### Development Setup

**Mailtrap Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  host: 'smtp.mailtrap.io',
  port: 2525,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MAILTRAP_USER,
    pass: process.env.MAILTRAP_PASS
  }
}
```

**Production SES:**
```javascript
{
  host: 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.AWS_SES_SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.AWS_SES_SMTP_PASS
  }
}
```

---

## Email Sending Best Practices

### Rate Limiting

- Max 10 emails per second per project
- Max 1000 emails per hour globally
- Implement exponential backoff for failures

### Retry Logic

- Retry failed sends up to 3 times
- Wait 1 min, 5 min, 15 min between retries
- Log all failures for manual review

### Bounce Handling

- Monitor bounce rates via SES
- Automatically suppress hard bounces
- Alert admin if bounce rate > 5%

### Tracking

- Track email opens (optional, privacy-conscious)
- Track link clicks for CTAs
- Monitor delivery rates
- Report metrics in admin dashboard

### Compliance

- Include physical address in footer
- Honor unsubscribe requests immediately
- Include email category in headers
- Store email logs for 30 days minimum

## Internationalization (Future)

For future multi-language support:

- Store templates in `/locales/{lang}/emails/`
- Use i18n library for variable translation
- Default to English (en-US)
- Detect client language from user preferences

---

## A/B Testing

Consider testing variations of:
- Subject lines (urgency vs. informational)
- CTA button text
- Email length (brief vs. detailed)
- Reminder timing (Day 3 vs. Day 5)

Track conversion rates and adjust accordingly.
