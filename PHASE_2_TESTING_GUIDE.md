### TEST 4: Edit and Resend Proposal (Admin)

#### Steps:
1. **In Admin Portal**, view the inquiry
2. **Notice the "Copy Proposal Link" button** now shows "(v1)"
3. **Click the proposal link** to view it
4. Alternatively, you can navigate to create a new version:
   - For now, we'll manually update via ProposalBuilder
   
#### For Vertical Slice (Manual Edit):
Since we haven't built the dedicated "Edit Proposal" UI yet, you can test versioning by:

1. **Open browser console**
2. **Run this code** to simulate admin edit:
   ```javascript
   // Get the proposal ID from the URL or console
   const proposalId = '[paste-proposal-id-here]';
   
   // Simulate edit (you can also update description, deliverables, etc.)
   const proposals = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('motionify_proposals'));
   const proposal = proposals.find(p => p.id === proposalId);
   
   if (proposal) {
     // Increment version
     proposal.version = (proposal.version || 1) + 1;
     
     // Add to edit history
     if (!proposal.editHistory) proposal.editHistory = [];
     proposal.editHistory.push({
       version: proposal.version - 1,
       editedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
       reason: proposal.feedback
     });
     
     // Reset status to 'sent'
     proposal.status = 'sent';
     proposal.updatedAt = new Date().toISOString();
     
     // Save back
     localStorage.setItem('motionify_proposals', JSON.stringify(proposals));
     
     console.log('✅ Proposal updated to version', proposal.version);
   }
   ```

3. **Refresh the proposal page**

#### Expected Results:
✅ Proposal now shows "v2" badge
✅ Blue banner appears: "✨ This proposal has been updated based on your feedback"
✅ Shows: "Version 2 • Last updated: [date]"
✅ Action buttons are **enabled again**
✅ Previous feedback is no longer blocking actions

✅ In admin portal:
   - "Copy Proposal Link" shows "(v2)"
   - Inquiry status can be updated back to "proposal_sent"

---

### TEST 5: Accept Proposal (Client)

#### Verify in Admin Portal:

## 🐛 Edge Cases to Test

### 1. Invalid Proposal ID

**Expected:**
- "Proposal Not Found" message
- Red file icon
- "Back to Home" link works

### 2. Already Responded Proposal
**Test:** Try to open a proposal you already accepted/rejected

**Expected:**
- Action buttons disabled
- Message: "You have already responded to this proposal"
- Shows response date and your feedback (if any)

### 3. Currency Conversion Display
**Test:** Create proposals with both USD and INR

**Expected:**
- USD proposal: Shows "$10,000 USD (≈ ₹8,30,000 INR)"
- INR proposal: Shows "₹80,000 INR (≈ $964 USD)"
- Conversion rate: 1 USD = 83 INR

### 4. localStorage Sharing

2. Open proposal in same browser (port 5173)

**Expected:**
- Data loads correctly (same localStorage)
- No CORS or data sync issues

### 5. Version Numbering
**Test:** Increment version multiple times

**Expected:**
- Version increments correctly: v1 → v2 → v3
- Edit history tracks each version

## 🚨 Known Limitations (Vertical Slice)

These are intentional for the vertical slice and will be addressed later:

1. **No Admin Edit UI** - Version incrementing tested via console for now
2. **No Razorpay Integration** - Payment placeholder only
3. **No Email Sending** - Console.log only
4. **No Expiry Tracking** - Proposals valid indefinitely
5. **No Balance Payment** - Only advance payment shown
6. **No Project Creation** - Happens in Phase 2b after payment

---

## 🐞 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Proposal not loading
**Solution:** 
- Check if proposal ID is correct
- Verify localStorage has data: `localStorage.getItem('motionify_proposals')`
- Clear cache and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Currency not converting
**Solution:**
- Check proposal has `currency` field set
- Verify conversion rate constant (USD_TO_INR = 83)

### Issue: TypeScript errors in IDE
**Solution:**
- Run `npm install` at the repository root
- Restart TypeScript server
- The errors about missing components should resolve after build

### Issue: Actions not updating status
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage is not full
- Check if both inquiry and proposal IDs are valid

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Phase 2b)

After successful testing, the next phase will add:

1. **Razorpay Payment Integration**
   - Replace payment placeholder with real checkout
   - Handle success/failure callbacks
   - Test with Razorpay test cards

2. **Project Creation After Payment**
   - Auto-create project in localStorage
   - Create mock user account
   - Show project dashboard

3. **Admin Proposal Edit UI**
   - Dedicated edit page with pre-filled data
   - Version increment on save
   - Email notification to client

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Review localStorage** data structure
3. **Verify all files** were created correctly
4. **Clear localStorage** and try fresh test
5. **Check port** - the Vite app should be on 5173

**Testing completed?** Mark Phase 2 as complete and proceed to Phase 2b (Razorpay Integration)! 🎉
