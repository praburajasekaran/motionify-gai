---

### TC-TM-005: ~~Client Requests Revision~~ ❌ NOT APPLICABLE
**Priority:** N/A  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** ❌ **INVALID TEST** - Tasks are for Motionify Studio team members only. Clients request revisions on **Deliverables**, not Tasks. See TC-DA-003.

> **Note:** This test case was incorrectly specified. For client revision requests, see: **TC-DA-003: Request Revision (Within Quota)** ✅ COMPLETE

---

### TC-TM-006: ~~Only Client PM Can Approve~~ ❌ NOT APPLICABLE
