## **MOTIONIFY STUDIO PORTAL**

### **Scope of Work & Phased Development Plan**

---

### **1\. Project Overview**

**Motionify Studio Portal** is a centralized digital platform that enables clients to explore, order, and manage creative video services from Motionify. The platform streamlines the entire workflow — from service selection and order registration to payment, production tracking, revisions, and final delivery — within a unified, secure, and automated environment.

In later phases, the system will extend to integrate **Freelancer Management**, allowing Motionify to onboard, assign, and compensate verified freelance creatives securely within the same ecosystem.

---

### **2\. Objectives**

* Automate the client ordering and production management lifecycle.

* Digitally handle contracts, NDAs, payments, revisions, and delivery tracking.

* Provide transparent communication and status tracking for both clients and Motionify team members.

* Establish a foundation for future integration with freelance contributors.

* Ensure data security, reliability, and scalability for a global creative production system.

---

### **3\. Scope of Work**

The project will be developed in **two main modules**, rolled out across multiple phases.
