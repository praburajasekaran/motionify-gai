❌ Use emojis excessively (1-2 max per message)
❌ Write long paragraphs (3 sentences max)

## Brand Voice Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- [ ] Is it **action-oriented**? (Does it inspire movement?)
- [ ] Is it **empowering**? (Does it make the user feel capable?)
- [ ] Is it **collaborative**? (Does it emphasize teamwork?)
- [ ] Is it **confident**? (Does it communicate with clarity?)
- [ ] Is it **human**? (Would you say this to a colleague?)

If you can answer "yes" to all five, you're speaking in Motionify's voice.

## Final Note

Our voice is energetic and empowering, but never at the expense of clarity. When in doubt, choose clear over clever. Our users are creating under pressure—we're here to make their lives easier, not harder.

**Remember:** Every word is an opportunity to make creators feel powerful, supported, and excited about their work.
